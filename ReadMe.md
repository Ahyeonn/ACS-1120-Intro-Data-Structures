# Tweet-Generator
This website was built for my ACS 1120, ‘Intro Data Structures’ class, and the project was built from practices such as pictogram, histogram, listogram, linked list, and hashtablem. This helped complete the project by generating random sentences that were part of a txt file by practicing a mark-ov chain and using Twitter API to be able to tweet the generated sentences to our Twitter account.
